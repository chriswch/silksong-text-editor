# Next.js + HeroUI Starter

An opinionated starter template to help me build Next.js apps with HeroUI quickly.
It comes preconfigured so you can clone, install, and start shipping without spending time on setup.

## Built-in

- Next.js 15
- HeroUI
- Tailwind CSS
- Prettier
- ESLint

## Quick Start

1. clone or just download the repo and unzip it

2. Install dependencies

   we use v24.7.0 here

   ```bash
   nvm use
   npm i -g bun
   bun i
   ```

3. Run the dev server

   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```

That's it. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.
Use your editor's Prettier integration to format, or run Prettier via your preferred workflow.
